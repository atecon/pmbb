The function implements the panel Moving Blocks Bootstrap (MBB) suggested and
analysed by Gonçalves, S. (2011, The moving blocks bootstrap for panel linear
regression models with individual fixed effects, Econometric Theory).

The panel MBB is different from the standard MBB of Kunsch (1989, The Jackknife
and the Bootstrap for General Stationary Observations, The Annals of Statistics)
and Liu and Singh (1992, Moving Blocks Jackknife and Bootstrap Capture Weak
Dependence. In: R. Lepage and L. Billard, Eds., Exploring the Limits of
Bootstrap, John Wiley, New York), because what is drawn in the resampling is the
vector containing the n individual observations at each point in time. The panel
MBB is robust to serial correlation (like the standard MBB), but also to
arbitrary forms of cross sectional dependence.

The simulations carried out in the paper show that the panel MBB performs well
even when the degree of serial and cross sectional correlation is large,
provided that the block size is appropriately chosen.
In the simulations, Goncalves adopts a data-driven approach, with a block size
equal on average to:
- 4.4 when T = 25;
- 7.9 when T = 50;
- 12.2 when T = 100.

Public function
===============

=======================================================
pmbb(const series y, const list X, int blocksize[1::4],
     int nboot[100::1000], int pseed[0::0])
=======================================================
The function computes and shows also the symmetric bootstrap percentile-t
confidence intervals of the coefficients at the 1%, 5% and 10% significance
level. The bootstrap percentile-t confidence intervals are calculated as:
beta_hat +/- q_alpha*se_beta
where:
- beta_hat is the FE estimate of the coefficient;
- se_beta is the sqrt of the bootstrap variance estimator based on B bootstrap
replications;
- q_alpha is the alpha*100 percentile of the absolute value of the Studentized
bootstrap statistic.
The bootstrap t-statistic is Studentized using the multivariate analogue of the
Götze and Kunsch (1996, Second-Order Correctness of the Blockwise Bootstrap for
Stationary Observations, The Annals of Statistics) variance estimator, adapted
to panel models by Goncalves (2011).

Please note that the function works only with perfectly balanced panels (no
missing observation).


Parameters:
-----------
  y         -- series, dependent variable
  X         -- list, regressors (without the constant which is added by default)
  blocksize -- int, Length of blocksize (default = 4)
  nboot     -- int, Number of bootstrap replications (default = 1000)
  pseed     -- int, Seed of pseudo-random number generator (default = 0 (none))

Returns:
--------
The function returns a bundle with:
- a matrix (beta) containing the vectors of coefficients in each of the
bootstrap replications;
- a matrix (tstat) containing the vectors of Studentized bootstrap statistic in
each replication.
