The function implements the panel Moving Blocks Bootstrap (MBB) suggested and
analyzed by GonÃ§alves, S. (2011, The moving blocks bootstrap for panel linear
regression models with individual fixed effects, Econometric Theory, forthcoming).

The panel MBB is different from the standard MBB of Kunsch (1989) and Liu and
Singh (1992), because what is drawn in the resampling is the vector containing the
n individual observations at each point in time.
The panel MBB is robust to serial correlation (like the standard MBB), but also to
arbitrary forms of cross sectional dependence.

The simulations carried out in the paper show that the panel MBB performs well
even when the degree of serial and cross sectional correlation is large, provided
that the block size is appropriately chosen.
In the simulations, Goncalves adopts a data-driven approach, with a block size
equal on average to:
- 4.4 when T = 25;
- 7.9 when T = 50;
- 12.2 when T = 100.

The function has the following arguments:
- the series of the dependent variable;
- the list of regressors (without the constant which is added by default);
- the block size (default size: 3);
- number of replications (default number: 1000);
- seed of the pseudo-random number generator (default 0 = auto).

The function returns a bundle with:
- a matrix (beta) containing the vectors of coefficients in each of the bootstrap
replications;
- a matrix (tstat) containing the vectors of Studentized bootstrap statistic in
each replication.

The function computes and shows also the symmetric bootstrap percentile-t
confidence intervals of the coefficients at the 1%, 5% and 10% significance level.
The bootstrap percentile-t confidence intervals are calculated as: beta_hat +/-
q_alpha*se_beta
where:
- beta_hat is the FE estimate of the coefficient;
- se_beta is the sqrt of the bootstrap variance estimator based on B bootstrap
replications;
- q_alpha is the alpha*100 percentile of the absolute value of the Studentized
bootstrap statistic.
The bootstrap t-statistic is Studentized using the multivariate analog of the
Gotze and Kunsch (1996) variance estimator, adapted to panel models by Goncalves
(2011).

Please note that the function works only with perfectly balanced panels (no
missing observation).
